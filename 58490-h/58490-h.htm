<p>Of the first 225 men sent over from
London to settle at Jamestown in 1607 and
1608, seven were practitioners of medicine&mdash;as
it was then practiced: Walter Russell,
Gent., was a &ldquo;Doctour of Physicke,&rdquo; which
is to say that he had studied at a university and earned a
degree in medicine; Thomas Wotton, Will Wilkinson, and
Post Ginnat were listed as surgeons&mdash;&ldquo;chirurgeon&rdquo; as
it then appeared; Thomas Field and John Harford bore
the label of apothecaries; and the seventh was &ldquo;Tho:
Cowper the Barber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plainly, the Virginia Company of London, numbering
several prominent medical men among its backers, wanted
its adventurers to the New World to have the best of
medical care. Unfortunately for about four of every five
settlers in the first few years at Jamestown, the best was
not enough to avert wholesale mortality from sickness,
Indian arrows, and &ldquo;meere famine.&rdquo; That some of the
medical men shared the fate of their patients seems likely
in the absence of later information about most of them.</p>
<p>Medical theories and practices at the beginning of the
seventeenth century were largely those that had prevailed
since the time of Galen, a Greek physician who died about
two centuries after Christ. According to Galen, the four
elements of Aristotelian science&mdash;fire, water, air, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
earth&mdash;comprised the four major humors of the human
body: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. Blood
was held to be moist and warm, phlegm was moist and
cool, yellow bile dry and warm, and black bile dry and cold.</p>
<p>Sickness, in the theory of Galen, was caused by one or
more of these humors becoming impure or out of place
or out of balance. Treatment thus consisted of removing
or diminishing the offending humor by purging, bleeding,
vomiting, blistering, urinating, sweating, or salivating;
on the other hand, a deficient humor was to be restored
by diet and drugs. Galen classed drugs according to their
warm, cold, moist, or dry qualities. For instance, pepper
was a heating drug, good for chills, while cucumber was
a cool one, to be given in case of fever.</p>
<p>Galenism had been subjected to attack in the sixteenth
century by Paracelsus and Vesalius, but its appeal was
logical and remained strong in seventeenth-century England.
(In fact, some survivals can be found in twentieth-century
folk medicine.) Dr. Lawrence Bohun (or Boone), who
came over in 1610 and returned to England in 1611, spent
some of the year investigating medicinal sources in Virginia.
He discovered a white clay&mdash;and shipped some to England&mdash;that
he claimed could absorb and expel poisons from the
body. Among vegetable remedies, Bohun experimented
with sassafras and found &ldquo;<i>Galbanum mechoacon</i>, otherwise
called <i>rubarbum alum</i>, to be of service in cold moist
bodies, for the purginge of fleame [phlegm] and superfluous
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><i>WHAT IS AN APOTHECARY?</i></span></h2>
<p>Already it will be evident that the practice of medicine
in seventeenth-century England, and hence in the first
American colonies, was not neatly confined to the licensed
graduates of accredited medical schools. Quite the contrary.
In fact, Henry VIII had complained that all kinds
of ignorant people got into the act, including &ldquo;Smiths,
Weavers, and Women.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>In the upper half of this woodcut from <span class="f">The Expert Doctor&rsquo;s Dispensary</span>, published in
London in 1657, a learned physician is shown conducting a urinalysis. He simply holds the
flask of liquid to the light for visual examination. Below, a customer presents what appears
to be a written prescription to be filled by the apothecary.</i></p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>Two centuries of legal and parliamentary pulling and
hauling, plus the consequence of some natural developments,
left the situation in England somewhat stabilized&mdash;but
not necessarily logical. The barbers, chartered as a
guild in 1462 and authorized to practice surgery, included
both barbers and surgeons in growing disharmony until
they were formally divorced in 1745.</p>
<p>The apothecaries&mdash;the word originally meant shopkeeper&mdash;joined
the guild of grocers at one time but shortly
broke away to form their own guild in 1617. Meantime,
the physicians, organized in the College of Physicians,
obtained the right to keep watch on the apothecaries.</p>
<p>Physicians, who had to have as much as 14 years training
and four degrees from Oxford or Cambridge, were
naturally not abundant. Being learned men, they would
not stoop to the indignity of such menial work as performing
surgical operations or compounding medicines. The
former was the province of the surgeon or barber-surgeon,
the latter was the specialty of the apothecary.</p>
<p>But the scarcity of physicians, especially in rural areas,
left a medical gap that the apothecaries, trained through
apprenticeship and many times more numerous, naturally
moved to fill. In 1727 English law finally recognized and
legalized the fact that for most people the apothecary-surgeon
was the only available practitioner of medicine.
In turn, the business of purveying drugs and compounding
medicines passed from the apothecaries to the wholesale
druggists and pharmaceutical chemists.</p>
<p>As it was transferred to America the trade of apothecary&mdash;it
was neither a craft nor a profession in any strict sense&mdash;was
probably much like that of the rural apothecary-surgeon
of seventeenth-century England. The apothecary
still made his living primarily from the provision of drugs
and medical preparations; but he also performed amputations,
dressed wounds, and subjected his patients to
the normal medical treatments of the day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><i>ALL THAT THE LAW ALLOWS</i></span></h2>
<p>Virginia was the only colony that tried to draw legislative
boundaries around the various aspects of medical practice.
The effort came in 1736 in the form of &ldquo;an Act for Regulating
the Fees and Accounts of the Practicers of Phisic.&rdquo;
On two grounds the act deserves to be quoted at some
length. For one thing, it throws a good light on the state
of medical practice at that time. For another, it affords
undeniable parallels to some current problems in the cost
of medicines and medical care, and to the role of government
in serving the interests of the &ldquo;consumer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig2">

<p class="pcap"><i>An eighteenth-century operating chair, fully equipped with tilting back, padded

unknown.  The illustration is taken from Denis Diderot&rsquo;s famous encyclopedia of
arts and sciences.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The first section of the act recited certain abuses, especially
of the surgeons and apothecaries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I. Whereas the practice of phisic in this colony, is most
commonly taken up and followed, by surgeons, apothecaries,
or such as have only served apprenticeships to
those trades, who often prove very unskilful in the art
of a phisician; and yet do demand excessive fees, and
exact unreasonable prices for the medicines which they
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
administer, and do too often, for the sake of making
up long and expensive bills, load their patients with
greater quantities thereof, than are necessary or useful,
concealing all their compositions, as well to prevent the
discovery of their practice, as of the true value of what
they administer: which is become a grievance, dangerous
and intolerable, as well to the poorer sort of people as
others, &amp; doth require the most effectual remedy that
the nature of the thing will admit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second section then proceeded to emphasize the
chief distinction between the apprentice-trained apothecary-surgeons
and the university-educated physicians by allowing
the latter to charge twice as much for their services
as the former could. If the apothecaries and surgeons
felt&mdash;as well they might have&mdash;that the difference in fees
was an insult to them, it did not last long. The law was
not renewed at the following session of the Assembly;
perhaps its backers, the physicians, had seen their
patients flock to the lower-priced practicers.</p>
<p>Although Virginia was the only colony to set medical
fees by law, the practice of legislative price fixing in other
areas of the economy was as common in colonial America as
it was in England. In Virginia, to be specific, not only
prices and quantities but in some cases even qualities
of goods and services offered to the public by tavernkeepers,
shoemakers, millers, and ferrymen were regulated by law.
The economic philosophy and terminology of <i>laissez faire</i>
were among the alien isms imported after 1776. During
the colonial years, government rarely hesitated to act in
the economic field where the need was felt.</p>
<p>From this particular Virginia law of 1736 it would appear
that some if not all medical charges had gotten well out
of line&mdash;the correct line, of course, being what the people
and their elected representatives thought was reasonable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>II. BE it therefore enacted, ...</p>
<p>That from and after the passing of this
act, no practicer in phisic, in any action or
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>

in any court of record in this colony, shall

</blockquote>
<p>Lest it appear that all Williamsburg &ldquo;practicers&rdquo; made
a habit of charging excessive fees, the generous treatment
an earlier doctor gave at least one of his patients must be
set down. George Hume, a Scottish merchant who came
to Virginia about 1722 and soon caught all the prevalent
ills, found the place &ldquo;only good for doctors and ministers
who have very good encouragem&rsquo;nt here.&rdquo; One of
the &ldquo;common distempers&rdquo; that afflicted Hume was dysentery,
then called the flux. He was laid so low that Dr.
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
John Brown all but despaired of his life. Hume&rsquo;s gratitude
for being cured was doubtless enhanced by the fact&mdash;carefully
reported to his Scottish relatives&mdash;that &ldquo;ye Dr.
took nothing for my druggs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The third section of the act, specifying exactly what
the &ldquo;practicer of phisic&rdquo; should set forth in his bill, bears
if least a faint augury of modern food-and-drug labeling
legislation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>III. And to the end the true value of the medicines administered
by any practicer in phisic, may be better
known, and judged of, <i>Be it further enacted, by the
authority aforesaid</i>, That whenever any pills, bolus,
portion, draught, electuary, decoction, or any medicines,
in any form whatsoever, shall be administered
to any sick person, the person administering the same
shall, at the same time, deliver in his bill, expressing
every particular thing made up therein; or if the medicine
administered, be a simple, or compound, directed
in the <i>dispensatories</i>, the true name thereof shall be
expressed in the same bill, together with the quantities
and prices, in both cases. And in failure thereof, such
practicer, or any apothecary, making up the prescription
of another, shall be nonsuited, in any action or suit
hereafter commenced, which shall be grounded upon
such bill or bills: Nor shall any book, or account, of
any practicer in phisic, or any apothecary, be permitted
to be given in evidence, before a court; unless the
articles therein contained, be charged according to
the directions of this act.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This final section reveals that some differentiation between
the branches of the medical profession had already
begun in America. The tip-off is the phrase that imposes
on &ldquo;any apothecary making up the prescription of another&rdquo;
the same requirements as on physicians who make up their
own prescriptions.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><i>THE DOCTORS OF WILLIAMSBURG</i></span></h2>
<p>If competition tends to keep prices low, fees charged in
and around the capital city in the early eighteenth century
should have been at the rock bottom level. Governor
Gooch in 1729 reported to London that Williamsburg
abounded in physicians. The same year young Adam
Cunningham gave up his brief effort to establish himself
in practice as a doctor:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="768" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Another illustration from the Diderot encyclopedia shows the operation of trepanning
a skull and some surgical tools in common use in the eighteenth century, in colonial
America as well as in Europe.</i></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Williamsburg [he wrote] is but a small Village containing
not more than 60 families, at most; and in and about
this City are no less than 25 or 30 phisitians, and of that
number not above 2 capable of living handsomly. So that I
did not think it proper to stay, in a place where so many
of my profession are lickely to starve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Little is known about any of these &ldquo;phisitians,&rdquo; not
even the names of most. It seems fairly sure, however,
that a number were quacks. Gooch had complained in
the same letter about the &ldquo;unskilfulness of practioners in
this country&rdquo; but was gullible enough himself to pay 60
pounds from public funds and give freedom to a Negro
slave for the secret of the latter&rsquo;s alleged cure of venereal
diseases. It turned out to be a decoction of roots and barks,
which the Governor avowed to be &ldquo;a certain Remedy
here&rdquo; and sent samples so the College of Physicians could
try its effect in England.</p>
<p>Most of Gooch&rsquo;s abundant physicians almost certainly
made up their own prescriptions. From 1622 at Jamestown
until 1731 in Williamsburg no mention of an apothecary
in Virginia has been found in historical records. In
the latter year, however, there were four shops purveying
drugs and compounding medicines in Williamsburg. The
proprietors of two were doctors&mdash;Dr. George Gilmer and
Dr. Kenneth McKenzie; the other two were druggists or
&ldquo;chymists&rdquo;&mdash;Thomas Wharton and Thomas Goodwin.</p>
<p>Goodwin did not remain independent long. After about
two years he joined Dr. Robert Davidson, mayor of Williamsburg,
in a partnership that was itself dissolved in
two years by the death of Dr. Davidson. Thomas Wharton,
on the other hand, kept shop in Williamsburg for some
eleven years. He had arrived in Virginia about 1703 as an
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
indentured servant to a Dr. Richard Wright and had
acquired by the time of his death in 1746 not only a pharmaceutical
business, but the title of &ldquo;Doctor.&rdquo; He willed his
drugs, medicines, and shop utensils to Dr. McKenzie.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small"><i>SHOPKEEPER EXTRAORDINARY</i></span></h2>
<p>The fourth named practicer, George Gilmer, Sr., deserves
extended attention. He comes as close as any one person
to being a typical Williamsburg apothecary-surgeon-physician
of his time, though his extramedical career was far
from typical.</p>
<p>Born in Edinburgh in 1700, Gilmer studied medicine
there, then practiced with one of London&rsquo;s leading doctors,
whose daughter he married. Possibly the death of his
young wife moved him to ship for America; at the age of
31 he arrived in Virginia to practice medicine and manage
the affairs of a land company. He married again and
must have prospered, because in four years&rsquo; time he was
able to purchase for &pound;155 three choice lots near the Governor&rsquo;s
Palace in Williamsburg.</p>
<p>These three lots, on which the rambling St. George
Tucker House has stood since 1788, were described in
1735 as &ldquo;the Lotts and Land whereon the Bowling Green
formerly was, the Dwelling House and Kitchen of William
Levingston and the House call&rsquo;d the Play House.&rdquo; The
last, of course, was the first theater in the English colonies,
and Gilmer later sold it to the mayor and aldermen of
Williamsburg to be used as a city hall and courthouse.
It was a particularly convenient arrangement for one of
the aldermen who was to become mayor himself a year
later, none other than Dr. George Gilmer.</p>
<p>Gilmer&rsquo;s career as an apothecary-surgeon-physician
was not without its ups and downs. Soon after buying the
property on Palace Green, he was giving away samples of
rattlesnake root on behalf of Dr. John Tennent, who maintained
it would cure pleurisy, the gout, rheumatism, and
mad-dog bites.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>At the same time the <i>Virginia Gazette</i>, Williamsburg&rsquo;s
new weekly, carried the news that &ldquo;on <i>Monday</i> Morning
last, dy&rsquo;d, at Mr. <i>Geo. Gilmer&rsquo;s</i>, in this City, Mrs. <i>Susanna
Skaife</i>, ... and was decently interr&rsquo;d on <i>Wensday</i>. And, on
<i>Thursday</i> Morning also dy&rsquo;d, the Rev. Mr. <i>John Skaife</i>, her
Husband, after a tedious Indisposition.&rdquo; It would appear
that at least Mrs. Skaife was a bed patient in Dr. Gilmer&rsquo;s
home; this was a usual way of caring for serious illnesses
before the day of hospitals.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="718" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Surrounded by the equipment of his craft, this young apothecary is making up a

and in Richmond, Virginia.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Soon thereafter, Gilmer found it necessary to insert the
following advertisement in the <i>Virginia Gazette</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="lr">Williamsburg <i>May</i> 26, 1737.</span></p>
<p><i>There being a Report industriously spread about the
Country, of <span class="f">George Gilmer&rsquo;s</span> Death, by some well-meaning
People, and of his being so much in Debt, that nothing from
<span class="f">England</span> would be sent him this Year, <span class="f">if alive</span>.</i></p>
<p><i>To obviate such scandalous and groundless <span class="f">Reports</span>, I

at my Old Shop, near the <span class="f">Governor&rsquo;s</span>.</i></p>
<p><span class="lr">George Gilmer</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nine years later Gilmer was so much alive and active
as to be mayor of the city, the owner of a new four-wheeled
chaise, and once more a bridegroom. On the death of
his second wife, Gilmer had promptly married his next-door
neighbor. The third Mrs. Gilmer was Harrison
Blair, daughter of Dr. Archibald Blair and sister of the
Hon. John Blair of the governor&rsquo;s council. The apothecary&rsquo;s
star was rising.</p>
<p>He was still, of course, a shopkeeper. His &ldquo;Old Shop
near the Governor&rsquo;s&rdquo; stood at the very edge of Palace
Green, a frame building of about 20 feet square. Every
year or so he advertised the arrival from England of a
shipment of drugs, medicines, spices, and groceries&mdash;to be
sold at the shop, wholesale or retail, and at reasonable rates.</p>
<p>Archaeological excavations on the site of the first theater,
and extending north of it onto the adjacent Brush-Everard
House property, yielded quantities of Dr. Gilmer&rsquo;s domestic
and pharmaceutical rubbish. The latter included delftware
ointment pots and drug jars, glass medicine phials
and fragments of carboys, bottles for Pyrmont mineral
water, a brass pestle, and, inexplicably, a human jaw. Just
how, or if, that related to Gilmer&rsquo;s shop remains open to
conjecture, but it is evident from the quantity of pharmaceutical
artifacts recovered that Dr. Gilmer&rsquo;s business was
as extensive as his 1737 advertisement claimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Indeed, Gilmer was no ordinary shopkeeper. His social
status&mdash;doubtless bolstered by that of his wife&rsquo;s family&mdash;was
great enough that he could be among the first to
entertain the newly appointed Governor Dinwiddie. One
suspects that either the ambitious Dr. Gilmer or his well-born
wife decided that his house on Palace Street fell
short of such prestigious demands. Six months after the
dinner for Dinwiddie, the apothecary was having his
dining room wainscoted, with a marble fireplace, a mirror
over the mantel, and a cabinet to contain the set of new
china his wife had ordered from London.</p>
<p>About the same time Dr. Gilmer, who gave himself perhaps
facetiously the title of &ldquo;colonel,&rdquo; became part owner
of the Raleigh Tavern. The deed by which he and Colonel
Chiswell bought the famous inn for &pound;700 testified that
he had gained that ultimate accolade of social and economic
status in colonial Virginia, the designation &ldquo;Geo
Gilmer Gent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the letters he wrote to London, Gilmer seems to refer
to himself not as a doctor or surgeon, but as an apothecary,
and his name in public documents as well as in private
records most often appears not as Dr. Gilmer but as Mr.
Gilmer. He was doubtless prouder of being known as a
gentleman and a colonel; the title of doctor was often
held in poor esteem. William Byrd II wrote in 1706 that
&ldquo;here be some men indeed that are call&rsquo;d Doctors: but
they are generally discarded Surgeons of Ships, that know
nothing above the very common Remedys.&rdquo; As late as
1783 Dr. Johann Schoepf, writing of his travels through
the former colonies, asserted that &ldquo;in America every man
who drives the curing trade is known without distinction
as Doctor, as elsewhere every person who makes verses
is a poet&mdash;so there are both black doctors and brown, and
quacks in abundance.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small"><i>THE EDUCATION OF AN APOTHECARY</i></span></h2>
<p>Apprenticeship was the usual form of training for all
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
colonial occupations, with the possible exception of the
ministry at one end of the scale and ordinary farming at
the other. Medicine was not an exception; practitioners
normally took apprentices for the same reasons that cabinetmakers
or blacksmiths did. The beginning apprentice
performed the unskilled and some of the semiskilled duties
of the establishment, learning as he did so. As he acquired
knowledge, he could give the doctor more and more assistance
in his practice.</p>
<p>The doctor generally undertook, if there was a formal
indenture, to teach the apprentice the &ldquo;art and mystery
of physic, surgery, and pharmacy,&rdquo; or words to that
effect. Sometimes, however, he agreed to teach only the
art of the apothecary. In either event, the apprentice was
taught to compound medicines as directed by his master,
to search the woods for medicinal plants, and probably to
keep books and collect fees. Even an apprentice apothecary
might in time be called on to assist&mdash;or perhaps even
take over&mdash;such routine treatments as bleeding. Most
likely he also had to spend his evenings reading whatever
medical or pharmaceutical works the doctor had on hand&mdash;from
Hippocrates to the latest edition of the <i>Edinburgh
Pharmacopoeia</i>.</p>
<p>On completing this apprenticeship&mdash;which in most cases
probably fell short of the English norm of seven years&mdash;the
young man could set up in the &ldquo;curing trade&rdquo;, for himself,
with no more credentials than his master&rsquo;s certificate to
the effect that he had served a certain term and had studied
certain books. Or he could go to Edinburgh or London
for further study at a university or in a hospital.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<div class="img" id="fig5">

<p class="pcap"><i>Another plate from Diderot&rsquo;s encyclopedia shows a variety of instruments used by eighteenth-century

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>In any event, there was no requirement that a dealer in
drugs or a practicer of medicine must have a degree, a
license, or any other recommendation than his own assurance
of good results to the sick who applied to him. Some
practitioners were on the modest side in offering their
services; some were wholly unrestrained&mdash;even guaranteeing
to cure cancer! The contrast stands out sharply in these
two advertisements from the <i>Virginia Gazette</i>, the first
in 1771 by Dr. William Stark of the town of Blandford,
the second five years later by a quack who did not even
bother to give himself the title of doctor.</p>

Coughs, Scurvy, any Kind of running Humours or scorbutic
Disorders, the Yaws and <i>French</i> Disorder, without Salivation,
sore Legs, Dropsy, Scurvy in the Gums, and has the
greatest Reason to believe he can cure the Consumption if

</blockquote>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small"><i>LINES OF SUCCESSION</i></span></h2>
<p>In a very direct and personal way, each generation
of Williamsburg physician-apothecary trained its successor.
Two particularly illustrative lines began with Dr. George
Gilmer.</p>
<p>At one time in 1745 it appears that Gilmer had an
apprentice by the name of James Carter. A few years
later Carter opened an apothecary shop of his own at the
sign of the Unicorn&rsquo;s Horn, next door to the Raleigh
Tavern in Williamsburg. Carter in turn took Andrew
Anderson as apprentice, and in due time when Anderson
had attain the status of &ldquo;doctor,&rdquo; took him into partnership.
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
This combination lasted only two years, and James
Carter later formed a partnership with his brother William,
a physician. After another few years James sold his share
of the apothecary shop to William but apparently continued
independently to practice medicine until his death
in 1794.</p>
<p>Gilmer, of course, had long since taken another apprentice
in young James Carter&rsquo;s place. Billy Pasteur was the
son of the barber and wigmaker, who could not afford to
send his son abroad for medical study. But at the end of
his apprenticeship, Pasteur did go to London with the
help of Dr. Gilmer for a year&rsquo;s study at St. Thomas&rsquo;s
Hospital. He returned to Williamsburg and opened shop
just after his benefactor&rsquo;s death. It would seem probable
that he took over Gilmer&rsquo;s shop before building his own,
though the record does not say.</p>
<p>Pasteur, in his own turn, had at least two apprentices
who later practiced in Williamsburg. The second, Robert
Nicolson, shortly moved his apothecary shop and medical
practice to Yorktown, thereby taking himself out of this
narrative. His predecessor, John Minson Galt, remained
in Williamsburg and in the medical profession until 1808.
Like Dr. Gilmer, who educated his own son, George Gilmer,
Jr., in medicine, John Minson Galt launched two of his
sons into medicine via apprenticeship.</p>
<p>A son of Samuel Galt, the silversmith, John Minson
Galt was apprenticed at the age of 14 to William Pasteur,
who himself had just set up shop and was only half a dozen
years older. The apprenticeship appears to have lasted a
full term of seven years. It was followed by two years of
medicine in London. There the young man studied the
theory and practice of physic under Dr. Hugh Smith,
midwifery under Dr. Colin McKenzie, and surgery,
anatomy, and operations at St. Thomas&rsquo;s Hospital. Galt
is also said to have attended the College of William and
Mary&mdash;presumably before going abroad&mdash;and to have
pursued his medical studies in Edinburgh and Paris as
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
well as in London. All of this made John Minson Galt
undoubtedly the best educated apothecary-surgeon of eighteenth-century
Williamsburg.</p>
<p>On his return to Williamsburg in 1769 he bought &ldquo;a
box of Surgeon&rsquo;s Instruments,&rdquo; married Judith Craig, and
announced his intention to open shop at &ldquo;the Brick House,
opposite the Coffee House when he gets his utensils fixed.&rdquo;
The <i>Virginia Gazette</i>&rsquo;s notice of the marriage was short and
full of confident optimism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This evening Doctor JOHN MINSON GALT, of this
city, was married to Miss JUDITH CRAIG, eldest
daughter of Mr. ALEXANDER CRAIG. The mutual
affection and familiarity of disposition in this agreeable
pair, afford the strongest assurance of their enjoying the
highest felicity in the nuptial state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In setting up shop as an apothecary-surgeon in Williamsburg,
Galt was not exactly filling a vacuum. In fact, the
same issue of the <i>Gazette</i> in which he announced himself
carried long advertisements by two other apothecaries.
One was Galt&rsquo;s former master and benefactor, William
Pasteur; the other was &ldquo;Andrew Anderson, Surgeon and
Man-Midwife,&rdquo; also just launching in practice. Altogether
the ads occupy a little over one whole column of the paper,
and each consists almost solely of a list of the items available
at that shop.</p>
<p>It is interesting to notice that William Pasteur had
imported a new supply of goods in the same ship with
Galt&rsquo;s &ldquo;compleat assortment,&rdquo; and just in time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The subscriber having had but very few medicines left
in his shop before this order came to hand, will now be
able to furnish his friends and customers with every thing
fresh and genuine. Gentlemen practitioners, and others, may
depend on being supplied at a very low advance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The final assurance echoes Pasteur&rsquo;s earlier complaint
written his London agents to the effect that &ldquo;tiss hardly
worth our while to import medicines for sale we are Oblige
to sell at a low advance on acc<sup>t</sup> of our confounded druggist
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
here....&rdquo; The &ldquo;confounded druggist,&rdquo; William Biers, was
having his own difficulties making a living, however, and
soon sold out to the partnership of James Carter and
Andrew Anderson.</p>
<p>Colonial Williamsburg owns several of Dr. Galt&rsquo;s account
books, including the one for the years 1770 to 1775, before
he joined Pasteur. One of the early entries shows a charge
against Thomas Glass of ten shillings for &ldquo;visiting &amp;c.&rdquo;
The corresponding credit entry shows that the bill was
paid in cash seven years and five months later! Patients
were as lax about paying their doctor&rsquo;s bills then as now,
and although most of Dr. Galt&rsquo;s patients paid in cash, he
also took wood, hay, and oats. On one instance he wrote
off a debt with an equal credit &ldquo;for the Runaway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What is surely the most provocative entry occurs opposite
February 29, 1772, a Leap Year Day. On that
date appears a debit against a Mr. Bowyer of 10 shillings
for &ldquo;attend<sup>ce</sup> in the night.&rdquo; On the credit side are these
words in Galt&rsquo;s hand: &ldquo;Twas sewed on by a Girl who I
shou&rsquo;d be happy with.&rdquo; Does this mean that in three
short years the &ldquo;mutual affection and familiarity of disposition&rdquo;
of John and Judith had worn away? The account
book does not answer.</p>
<p>Notice that Galt&rsquo;s charge of 10 shillings for visiting a
patient was the very sum permitted by law in 1736&mdash;three
and a half decades earlier. For amputating Mr. Parson&rsquo;s
finger and dressing it he charged &pound;3 4<i>s</i> 6<i>d</i>, and the same
amount to Mr. Cardwell for &ldquo;laying open Child&rsquo;s leg &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is but a single entry for bleeding, and in this case
the patient was a Negro. Dr. Galt, unlike most of his
colleagues, seems not to have favored phlebotomy. The
great number of entries simply mention visiting, attendance,
or advice, with prescriptions by the score of cathartics,
emetics, purges, etc.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small"><i>PASTEUR &amp; GALT</i></span></h2>
<p>It must have been a source of gratification to John
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
Minson Galt when the well-established Pasteur invited
the younger man to become his partner. The announcement
of the new firm read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="lr">WILLIAMSBURG, <i>April</i> 15, 1775.</span></p>
<p>THE Subscribers having this Day entered into Partnership,
beg Leave to acquaint the Public in general, and their
Friends and Neighbours in particular, that they intend
practicing Physic and Surgery to their fullest Extent; and
that they intend also, as soon as the Situation of the Times
will admit, to keep full and complete Assortments of Drugs
and Medicines, which they will endeavour to procure of the
very best in Quality, and will take Care to have them fresh
by making several Importations in the Year. It is proposed
that <i>John M. Galt</i> shall pay his particular Attention to
Surgery, to whom our Friends are desired to apply on all
such occasions, but will be advised and assisted by <i>W.
Pasteur</i> in all difficult Cases. They both desire to make their
most grateful Acknowledgments to their Friends and Customers
for the many Favours and Civilities they have received,
and hope, by this Union, they will be enabled to
carry on their Business to the entire Satisfaction of their
Friends; as, on their Part, the strictest Assiduity and Attention
shall be observed.</p>
<p><span class="lr">PASTEUR &amp; GALT</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only a few days after this announcement appeared, the
spark of revolution flared out in both Lexington, Massachusetts,
and Williamsburg, Virginia. As it happened,
Dr. Pasteur was to play a minor role and a momentary one
on the Williamsburg stage. Governor Dunmore&rsquo;s surreptitious
removal of the colony&rsquo;s gunpowder from the
Magazine was detected and there was an immediate
reaction from the populace, some under arms. Attending
a patient in the Palace, Dr. Pasteur was twice accosted by
the Governor and made the bearer of angry messages to
the Speaker of the House of Burgesses and &ldquo;the Gentlemen
of the Town.&rdquo; Should he be attacked, His Lordship blustered,
&ldquo;he would declare freedom to the slaves &amp; reduce the
city of Williamsburg to ashes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>What actually followed was that Dunmore and his family
fled the Palace, never to return, and Pasteur became the
next mayor of Williamsburg. It should be mentioned that
he and John Minson Galt were already members of the
Committee of Safety for the city when they formed their
partnership. The sympathies of both were clearly on the
patriot side.</p>
<p>The partners very shortly were able to advertise the
importation of the usual wide assortment of drugs and
medicines for sale in their shop on Duke of Gloucester
Street. And a few surviving bills indicate that they did
not lack for medical and surgical business. Dr. Pasteur,
it would seem, did not share his younger colleague&rsquo;s aversion
to phlebotomy, as the following excerpt from a Pasteur
&amp; Galt bill to Henry Morse Esq. in 1775 shows:</p>

<p>The partnership lasted only three years, for reasons
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
not now discernable, and William Pasteur gave notice to
the public that &ldquo;I purpose commencing oyster merchant&rdquo;
at his landing on King&rsquo;s Creek between Williamsburg and
Yorktown. Galt, on the other hand, continued to practice
medicine, serving as a senior surgeon to the Continental
military hospital in Williamsburg, joining in partnership
with Dr. Philip Barraud, and becoming visiting physician
to the public hospital for the insane and a member of its
board of directors. He held both offices until his death in
1808. Yet as late as 1794 he was identified in court records
as &ldquo;Apothecary, of the City of Williamsburg.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small"><i>THE APOTHECARY SHOP</i></span></h2>
<p>The Pasteur-Galt apothecary shop on Duke of Gloucester
Street in Williamsburg is a reconstruction. Its size
and location are determined with certainty not only from
an eighteenth-century town map, but also by eighteenth-century
foundations excavated on the site. The land was
owned by Dr. William Pasteur from 1760 until 1778, during
which time he probably built the shop. When he and
John Minson Galt dissolved their partnership, he sold the
property to Galt, who transferred it to his son at the end
of the century.</p>
<p>No record survives as to the exact appearance, outside
or inside, of the Pasteur-Galt shop. Some apothecary shops
apparently had as many as three rooms: the front shop, the
doctor&rsquo;s office and operating room, and possibly a sort of
laboratory where the apprentice compounded medicines.</p>
<p>The Pasteur-Galt shop has been reconstructed with two,
the preparative work being done in full view of the public.</p>
<p>As to the content of the shop, ample evidence comes
from almost any advertisement of Galt, Pasteur, or for
that matter of just about any apothecary in colonial
America at any time during the eighteenth century.
They all published for their prospective customers lengthy
lists of items just imported, and the lists bear a marked
resemblance from place to place and from time to time.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Analysis of the Galt or any other advertisement of the
time shows that the contents of a colonial apothecary
shop fell into five categories: plant materials, animal extracts,
metals and metallic derivatives, medical equipment,
and prepared elixirs, pills, and the like.</p>
<p>Among the most popular of the prepared medicines&mdash;judging
from the many advertisements of Dr. John Minson
Galt in the years 1772-1774&mdash;were Dr. Keyser&rsquo;s celebrated
anti-venereal pills. These were backed by testimonials
of two English and three French dukes, and Galt published
lengthy accounts avowing that &ldquo;the Patient is most
effectually cured without any Inconvenience to himself,
or being exposed to the Shame and Confusion of his Disaster
being known to the nicest Observer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only were they supposed to cure syphilis, but &ldquo;the
happy effects of <i>Keyser&rsquo;s</i> pills have often been proved in
white Swellings, asthmas, Suppressions of the Urine, in
the Palsy, Apoplexies, Sciaticks, in the Green Sickness,
and more especially in the Yaws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Rednapp&rsquo;s red fit drops&rdquo; were among Dr. Pasteur&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
favorite patent medicines, and Daffy&rsquo;s, Stoughton&rsquo;s, and
Bateman&rsquo;s elixirs or drops were distributed not only
by most colonial apothecaries but also by the keepers
of general stores, ship captains, and others. In 1771 no
fewer than nineteen packaged English medicines were
offered for sale at the Post Office in Williamsburg!</p>
<p>The formulas for some of these, consisting of twenty or
more separate ingredients, were printed in the principal
pharmacopoeias and were commonly made up by doctors
and apothecaries for their own use and for sale. Dr.
Pasteur and Dr. James Carter both ordered quantities of
empty bottles for Stoughton&rsquo;s and Daffy&rsquo;s compounds.</p>
<p>Dependence on imported patent medicines was a development
that several observers deplored. Dr. Schoepf, for
instance, thought American physicians should patriotically
discontinue &ldquo;making use almost wholly of foreign medicines,
with which in large measure they might easily
dispense, if they were willing to give their attention to
home-products, informing themselves more exactly of the
properties and uses of the stock of domestic medicines
already known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jefferson in his <i>Notes on the State of Virginia</i> had listed
twenty-one medicinal plants native to the state, and others
before him had commented on the abundance of simple
remedies afforded by the woods and marshes of tidewater
Virginia. Indeed, it appears that colonial medical men in
the seventeenth century had gathered the largest part of
their own medicines close at hand, and that the growing
importation of patent mixtures was matched by an increasing
export of native drugs.</p>
<p>By the middle of the eighteenth century considerable
quantities of at least eight medicinal plants were being
shipped to England from Virginia, among them ipecacuanha,
sassafras, balsam of Tolu, ginseng, and snakeroot. The
last two formed the bulk of the export; of them more in
a moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="744" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Seneca rattlesnake root or <span class="f">Polygala Virginiana</span> was a mainstay of medical treatment in
eighteenth-century Virginia. The original source of this drawing has not been identified.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>However, if there were in colonial towns &ldquo;some apothecaries
shops wainscotted or papered with advertisements,
recommending quack medicines,&rdquo; a large number of rural
practitioners preferred to make up their remedies. &ldquo;I do
not apply to the Apothecaries Shops for my Means,&rdquo; said
the advertisement of one such, &ldquo;I compact my own medicines
myself. The produce of <i>Virginia</i> Earth, with a few
trifles besides, supports my Body, ... and many others
besides, without bleeding, sweating, physicking, or Bitters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether used from conviction that such means were
better, or because the imported medicines were too expensive,
the result was the same: such mild cures were less
likely to interfere with the healing course of nature than
did the complex, often drastic, and sometimes revolting
compounds of the leading English physicians.</p>
<p>From inventories of the estates of deceased apothecaries
as well as from their newspaper advertisements comes
evidence as to the equipment they kept and used in their
shops. The remarkable thing is to see how little the
essential items have changed over the course of the centuries&mdash;alike
before and since the colonial era.</p>
<p>The mortar and pestle, traditional symbol of the apothecary&rsquo;s
calling and often used as the sign of his shop, was to
be found in Williamsburg shops in many sizes and materials.
The largest recorded was a bell-metal mortar and iron
pestle belonging to Dr. Thomas Wharton and weighing
168 pounds. Wharton also owned a large marble mortar
and pestle, two small ones of marble, and a &ldquo;Porphrey
Stone &amp; Muller.&rdquo; Later in the century, as the medical
profession learned that toxic quantities of metal dust
could come from the use of metal mortars, ceramic and
glass became widely used.</p>
<p>Glass and ceramic containers by the hundreds were
also used to store simple ingredients and compounds for
sale. Dr. Pasteur at one time, for instance, ordered 246
white glass vials ranging in capacity from two drams to
twelve ounces. Dr. Alexander Middleton, whose tory sympathies
cost him his Williamsburg shop and contents
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
during the Revolution, listed more than fifty dozen bottles,
from one ounce size to two gallons, along with dozens of
pill pots, ointment pots, and syrup pots. Glass seems to
have been the most common type of container, with earthenware
&ldquo;gallipots&rdquo; probably second.</p>
<p>Among the articles with which the Williamsburg shop
is furnished are a number that belonged to the first Dr.
Galt that have been obtained from his descendants or
generously loaned by them to Colonial Williamsburg. The
largest is the secretary-bookcase that stands in the back
office, the most numerous are the scores of glass bottles
and cardboard pillboxes that cluster on one section of the
shelves, and perhaps the most interesting are his diplomas
in anatomy, surgery, and midwifery that hang on the wall.
Vying with the last name is the account book displaying a
charge of 7 shillings against Patrick Henry&mdash;but no entry
to show that the bill was ever paid.</p>
<p>It would require more space than is here available to
describe, or even to list, all the articles in the shop today,
and to identify all the drugs, herbs, powders, and compounds
that would have been contained in the numerous bottles,
jars, boxes, and drawers of the shop. The quantity and
variety, however, may be taken as typical of a well provided
apothecary shop of colonial America.</p>
<p>One should note in particular the surgical instruments
in their velvet-lined cases. These have been collected
from various sources&mdash;including one case of lancets and
a set of scales from the Galt family&mdash;and are of the period.
Dr. Alexander Middleton claimed to have been deprived
in the Revolution of instruments for amputating, trepanning,
lithotomy, cupping, couching, dissecting, dentistry,
and midwifery. The estate of Dr. Kenneth McKenzie
of Williamsburg inventoried three sets of instruments for
amputating, trepanning, and lithotomy.</p>
<p>The McKenzie inventory also listed the medical books
in Dr. McKenzie&rsquo;s library. There were more than seventy
titles, of which all but a few were medical treatises, some
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
of them in several volumes. Among them were listed
<i>James&rsquo; Dispensatory</i> and <i>Shaw&rsquo;s Dispensatory</i>. These,
along with <i>Bate&rsquo;s Dispensatory</i> and the <i>London Dispensatory</i>
were among the most widely read, owned, and used books
in the colony, and not alone by doctors or apothecaries.
One or more was almost certain to be in the library of
every planter of tidewater Virginia, a kind of &ldquo;What to
do till the Doctor comes&rdquo; manual for the home treatment
of the planter himself, his wife and children, his relatives
and neighbors, and his slaves. These dispensatories
avoided the need or cost of a doctor&rsquo;s services unless the
trouble was so serious as to need &ldquo;expert&rdquo; attention.</p>
<p>This was by no means such an unwise system as at
first glance may appear. After all, the doctor would
probably dose with the same medicines from the same
dispensatory, and with the same result. And while quacks
were plentiful, well-trained physicians were extremely
scarce, especially in rural areas where pay was sure to be
slow and skimpy.</p>
<p>In view of the general state of medical knowledge and
practice throughout the eighteenth century&mdash;bleeding
being always a foremost treatment of numerous ailments&mdash;it
seems likely that the liberal use of native herbs,
being for the most part harmless, was probably the
safest and most effective course of medication. Surely
human and animal excreta, mashed-up insects, and the
like, which were not uncommon in London prescriptions,
could not have been more curative than rattlesnake root and
ginseng, whose praises were sung by the famous William
Byrd II:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Earth has never produced any vegetable so friendly
to man as Ginseng. Nor do I say this at Random, or by the
strength of my Faith, but by my own Experience. I have
found it very cordial and reviving after great Fatigue, it
warms the Blood, frisks the Spirits strengthens the Stomach
and comforts the Bowels exceedingly. All this it performs
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
with out any of those naughty Effects that might make men
too troublesome and impertinent to their poor Wives.</p>
<p>Then as for the Rattlesnake Root the Reputation of it
encreases every day. The Tincture of it has done Wonders
in the Gout.... By its purging, its deuretick, and diaphoretick
Qualities it is of great use in the Dropsy ... of great Efficacy
in Pleuretick Feaver ... [and] a Specifick against
worms....</p>
<p>For the Bite of a mad Dog, ... it may perhaps be as Sure
a Remedy; as for the Bite of a Rattlesnake.</p>

<h2 id="c9"><span class="small"><i>A List of Williamsburg Apothecaries</i></span></h2>
<p>This list includes only those medical practitioners of
eighteenth-century Williamsburg who operated apothecary
shops. It does not include physicians who may have
made up and dispensed their own prescriptions but did
not operate a shop.</p>
<p>Andrew Anderson (1768-1771)</p>
<p class="bq">Anderson studied medicine in England after
serving an apprenticeship with Dr. James Carter.
Anderson returned to Williamsburg in 1768 and
formed a partnership with Dr. Carter and they
purchased the shop of William Biers. Anderson

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
